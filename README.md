# dribble_clone

As of my knowledge, there are several platforms and applications related to design and creativity, and Dribbble is one of them. Dribbble is a social media platform for designers, artists, and other creative professionals to showcase their work, discover new talent, and connect with others in the design community.This project involved creating a user-friendly interface for designers to discover new inspirations.

Key features of a Dribbble clone includes:

- Users can create profiles to showcase their design portfolio, including projects, shots (individual pieces of work), and personal information.
- Users can organize their work into projects, making it easy for others to view and understand the context of their designs.
- The ability for users to upload individual shots, which are images or previews of their design work. These shots are often accompanied by descriptions and tags.
- Implemented features for users to like and share designs, fostering a sense of community and engagement similar to the Dribbble platform.
- Developed a search functionality and personalized recommendation system to help users discover new designs based on their preferences and interests.

Outcome:

Successfully created a fully functional Dribbble clone and this experience strengthened skills in front-end development, user interface design, and interaction design, contributing to an enhanced understanding of modern web development practices..
