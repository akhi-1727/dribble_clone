# dribble_clone

As of my knowledge, there are several platforms and applications related to design and creativity, and Dribbble is one of them. Dribbble is a social media platform for designers, artists, and other creative professionals to showcase their work, discover new talent, and connect with others in the design community.

Key features of a Dribbble clone includes:

- Users can create profiles to showcase their design portfolio, including projects, shots (individual pieces of work), and personal information.
- Users can organize their work into projects, making it easy for others to view and understand the context of their designs.
- The ability for users to upload individual shots, which are images or previews of their design work. These shots are often accompanied by descriptions and tags.
